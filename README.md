# My Unconventional Strategy for Acing The Data Science Interview

With the current job markets getting more competitive than ever, and meeting the job requirements alone is considered the minimum qualification, how do one stand out and successfully secure a data science job?

Essentially, I think of an interview as a sales process - the company is the buyer with their expectations, and you are the seller of your values. 

Often times, a sale is closed when the buy side (the company) is so convinced that they are getting a bargain for the price they pay, and the value it gains from having you far exceeds the cost they pay to have you. 

In other words, the company wants to hire the most valuable person, and you should demonstrate that you can offer such great value that the company cannot ignore you. 

On the individual level, if your value is 10x more valuable than the next person in line, you have such a leading edge among your competitors and even better, you could earn yourself a negotiation leverage. 

This guide is aimed to help you become the 10x version of yourself.

A little context, I steal these strategies from multiple consulting interview handbook - I found that the consulting interview's standard of a successful interview is very high. 

Action steps:
1. Effective understanding: simplify your thoughts, avoid jargon, clarify your emotions. 
2. Practice delivery: record and review your speaking regularly, use pauses instead of filler words, practice with bullet points instead of a script to improve the natural flow. 
3. Master the storytelling skills: add context, emotions, and vivid details to keep the audience engaged (*Show, Don't Tell*)
4. Immerse yourself in exellence: Learn from the master communicators who inspire you (in my case, I really like Seth Godin's communication style), and put yourself in a challenging environment to force yourself use your communication skills.

Question: Number Of Units Per Nationality 
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Airbnb

We have data on rental properties and their owners.
Write a query that figures out how many different apartments (use unit_id) are owned by people under 30, broken down by their nationality.
We want to see which nationality owns the most apartments, so make sure to sort the results accordingly.

airbnb_hosts table:
age        : bigint
gender     : text
host_id    : bigint
nationality: text

airbnb_units table:
city       : text
country    : text
host_id    : bigint
n_bedrooms : bigint
n_beds     : bigint
unit_id    : text
unit_type  : text

--- SOLUTION ---
select count(t1.host_id), t2.nationality
from 
    (select host_id, unit_type, country from airbnb_units 
    where unit_type = 'Apartment') t1
inner join 
    (select distinct host_id, nationality from airbnb_hosts
    where age < 30) t2
on t1.host_id = t2.host_id

group by t1.host_id, t2.nationality

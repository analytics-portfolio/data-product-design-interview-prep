Find the total number of downloads for paying and non-paying users by date.
Include only records where non-paying customers have more downloads than paying customers.
The output should be sorted by earliest date first and contain 3 columns: date, non-paying downloads, paying downloads.
Hint: In Oracle you should use "date" when referring to date column (reserved keyword).

ms_user_dimension table:
acc_id  : bigint
user_id : bigint

ms_acc_dimension table:
acc_id          : bigint
paying_customer : text

ms_download_facts table:
date       : date
downloads  : bigint
user_id    : bigint

with cte as 
    (select d.date, d.user_id, c.acc_id, c.paying_customer, d.downloads from 
    (select a.user_id, b.acc_id, b.paying_customer 
    from ms_user_dimension a join ms_acc_dimension b on a.acc_id = b.acc_id) c 
    join ms_download_facts d on c.user_id = d.user_id)

select a.date, a.non_paying_dwn, b.paying_dwn from 
    (select date, sum(downloads) as non_paying_dwn from cte
    where paying_customer = 'no'
    group by date, paying_customer) a
join 
    (select date, sum(downloads) as paying_dwn from cte
    where paying_customer = 'yes'
    group by date, paying_customer) b
on a.date = b.date
where non_paying_dwn > paying_dwn

Question: Revenue Over Time
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Amazon

Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased.
Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values.
Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month.
A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months.
The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year.
Assume each month has at least one purchase.

amazon_purchases table:
created_at   date
purchase_amt bigint
user_id      bigint

--- SOLUTION ---
SELECT t.month,
       AVG(t.monthly_revenue) OVER(
                                   ORDER BY t.month ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg_revenue
FROM
  (SELECT to_char(created_at::date, 'YYYY-MM') AS MONTH,
          sum(purchase_amt) AS monthly_revenue
   FROM amazon_purchases
   WHERE purchase_amt>0
   GROUP BY to_char(created_at::date, 'YYYY-MM')
   ORDER BY to_char(created_at::date, 'YYYY-MM')) t
ORDER BY t.month ASC

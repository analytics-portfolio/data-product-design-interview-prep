Question: Monthly Percentage Difference
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Amazon

Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue.
The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, 
and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.

sf_transactions table:
created_at   date
id           bigint
purchase_id  bigint
value        bigint

--- SOLUTION ---
WITH revenue_by_month AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
        SUM(value) AS monthly_revenue
    FROM sf_transactions
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM')
),
prev_month_revenue AS (
    SELECT 
        year_month, 
        monthly_revenue, 
        LAG(monthly_revenue) OVER(ORDER BY year_month ASC) AS prev_month_revenue
    FROM revenue_by_month
)
SELECT 
    year_month, 
    ROUND((monthly_revenue - prev_month_revenue)/prev_month_revenue * 100, 2) AS perc_monthly_change
FROM prev_month_revenue
ORDER BY year_month ASC

--- WALKTHROUGH ---
Simply calculate total revenue aggregated by month and find the previous monthly revenue
by LAG() function, then compute the percentage monthly change in the main query.

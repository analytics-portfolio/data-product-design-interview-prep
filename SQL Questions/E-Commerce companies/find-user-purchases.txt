Question: Finding User Purchases 
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Amazon

Identify returning active users by finding users who made 
a second purchase within 7 days of any previous purchase. 
Output a list of these user_ids.


amazon_transactions table:
created_at:     date
id:             bigint
item:           text
revenue:        bigint
user_id:        bigint

--- SOLUTION ---
WITH user_last_purchase_date AS (
    SELECT
        user_id, 
        created_at, 
        LAG(created_at) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at ASC) AS last_purchase_date
    FROM 
        amazon_transactions
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM user_last_purchase_date
WHERE created_at - last_purchase_date <=7
ORDER BY user_id ASC

--- WALKTHROUGH ---
Use CTE to find the last purchase date of each user_id using the LAG() function. 
Then find user_id with the datetime difference between the considering date and its corresponding previous purchase date
less than or equal to 7 days.

Question: Marketing Campaign Success [Advanced]
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Amazon

You have a table of in-app purchases by user.
Users that make their first in-app purchase are placed in a marketing campaign where they see call-to-actions for more in-app purchases.
Find the number of users that made additional in-app purchases due to the success of the marketing campaign.
The marketing campaign doesn't start until one day after the initial in-app purchase so users that only made one or multiple purchases on the first day do not count, nor do we count users that over time purchase only the products they purchased on the first day.

marketing_campaign table:
created_at:  date
price:       bigint
product_id:  bigint
quantity:    bigint
user_id:     bigint

--- SOLUTION ---
with first_purch_user_prod_id as (
    select * 
    from 
    (select user_id, 
          concat(user_id, '_', product_id) as user_prod_id, 
          created_at, product_id,
        rank() over (partition by user_id order by created_at) as rn
    from marketing_campaign) a
    where rn = 1
), 
cte as (select user_id, concat(user_id, '_', product_id) as user_prod_id
    from marketing_campaign
    where concat(user_id, '_', product_id) not in 
    (select user_prod_id from first_purch_user_prod_id))
    
select count(distinct user_id) from cte

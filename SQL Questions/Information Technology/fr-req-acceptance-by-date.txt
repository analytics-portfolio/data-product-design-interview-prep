Question: Friend Request Acceptance Rate By Date 
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Meta

Calculate the friend acceptance rate for each date when friend requests were sent. 
A request is sent if action = sent and accepted if action = accepted. 
If a request is not accepted, there is no record of it being accepted in the table. 
The output will only include dates where requests were sent and at least one of 
them was accepted, as the acceptance rate can only be calculated for those dates. 
Show the results ordered from the earliest to the latest date.

fb_friend_requests table:
action:                 text
date:                   date
user_id_receiver:       text
user_id_sender:         text


--- SOLUTION ---
WITH sent_request_by_date AS (
    SELECT
        date, 
        user_id_sender, 
        user_id_receiver
    FROM 
        fb_friend_requests
    WHERE
        action = 'sent'
),

accpt_request_by_date AS (
    SELECT
        date, 
        user_id_sender, 
        user_id_receiver
    FROM 
        fb_friend_requests
    WHERE
        action = 'accepted'
)

SELECT
    t1.date, 
    (count(t2.user_id_receiver) * 1.0)/count(t1.user_id_sender) AS acceptance_rate
FROM 
    sent_request_by_date t1
LEFT JOIN 
    accpt_request_by_date t2
ON t1.user_id_sender = t2.user_id_sender 
    AND t1.user_id_receiver = t2.user_id_receiver
GROUP BY t1.date

--- WALKTHROUGH ---
The key point in this question is how the acceptance rate by date is calculated:
Given a date A, the acceptance rate of date A is the count of requests sent on date A of unique sender-receiver ID pairs divides 
the count of requests accepted by those unique sender-receiver ID pairs (which might occur on later date).

I use 2 CTEs, one is for sent requests by date and by the sender-receiver ID pairs and the other is for 
accepted requests by date and by the sender-receiver ID pairs

The main SELECT I left join the accepted requests table (t2) with the sent requests table (t1)
since t1's date is the reference point for the acceptance rate by date in question. 
Once I join 2 tables, I compute the acceptance rate by date by counting rows where the t2.user_id_receiver 
is not null (which means these rows are friend requests sent that got accepted) and divides that with the 
total count of requests sent, the count is group by date.

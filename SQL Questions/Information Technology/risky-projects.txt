Question: Risky Projects 
Source: stratascrach
Companies: LinkedIn

Identify projects that are overbudget.
A project is overbudget if the prorated cost of all employees assigned to it exceeds the projectâ€™s budget.
To determine this, prorate each employee's annual salary to match the project's duration.
For example, if a project with a six-month duration has a budget of $10,000.
Output a list of overbudget projects with the following details: project name, project budget, and prorated total employee expenses (rounded up to the nearest dollar).
Hint: Assume all years have 365 days and disregard leap years.


linkedin_projects table: 
budget:     bigint
end_date:   date
id:         bigint
start_date: date
title:      text

linkedin_emp_projects table: 
emp_id:     bigint
project_id: bigint

linkedin_employees table: 
first_name: text
id:         bigint
last_name:  text
salary:     bigint

    linkedin_employees d on c.emp_id = d.id
)

select title, budget, ceiling(sum(prorated_expenses)) as total_emp_cost
from indiv_cost_per_project
group by title, budget
having budget < ceiling(sum(prorated_expenses)) 
order by title

Question: Popularity Percentage
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Meta

Find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook.
The dataset contains two columns, user1 and user2, which represent pairs of friends.
Each row indicates a mutual friendship between user1 and user2, meaning both users are friends with each other.
A user's popularity percentage is calculated as the total number of friends they have (counting connections from both user1 and user2 columns) divided by the total number of unique users on the platform.
Multiply this value by 100 to express it as a percentage.

Output each user along with their calculated popularity percentage.
The results should be ordered by user ID in ascending order.

facebook_friends table:
user1:  bigint
user2:  bigint


--- SOLUTION ---
WITH user_union AS (
    SELECT 
        user1, 
        user2
    FROM facebook_friends
    UNION 
    SELECT 
        user2 AS user1,
        user1 AS user2
    FROM facebook_friends
), 
total_num_users AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user1) as total_num
    FROM user_union
)

SELECT 
    user1, 
    (COUNT(*)::float)/(SELECT total_num FROM total_num_users) * 100 AS pop_perc
FROM user_union
GROUP BY user1
ORDER BY user1 ASC
    

--- WALKTHROUGH ---
I use UNION operation to union the facebook_friends table with itself, but the second facebook_friends table
has its columns swapped (user1 becomes user2 and vice versa). 
If user A is friend with user B aka a row (A, B), doing the union with create another row as user B is friend with user A
aka a row (B, A). This will ensure for every user, they will have all their friends on the column user2. 

Once we have a full table, we can compute the popularity percentage by dividing the # of friends of a given user with
the total number of distinct users. 


One key feature of UNION operator is that it removes duplicated row. 
For example, if the pair user1, user2 (1, 4) exists and during the UNION operation 
another (1, 4) is expected to be added to the final table, only one row of (1, 4) existed 
in the final table.

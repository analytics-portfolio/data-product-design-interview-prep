Question: Top Percentile Fraud
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Google, Netflix

We want to identify the most suspicious claims in each state.
We'll consider the top 5 percentile of claims with the highest fraud scores in each state as potentially fraudulent.
Your output should include the policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

fraud_score table:
claim_cost:   bigint
fraud_score:  double precision
policy_num:   text
state:        text


--- SOLUTION ---
WITH percentiles AS
  (SELECT state,
          percentile_cont(0.05) within GROUP (
                                              ORDER BY fraud_score DESC) AS percentile
   FROM fraud_score
   GROUP BY state)
SELECT policy_num,
       f.state,
       claim_cost,
       fraud_score
FROM fraud_score f
JOIN percentiles p ON f.state = p.state
WHERE fraud_score >= percentile

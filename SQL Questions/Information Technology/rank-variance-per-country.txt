Question: Rank Variance Per Country
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Meta

Which countries have risen in the rankings based on the number of comments between Dec 2019 vs Jan 2020? 
Hint: Avoid gaps between ranks when ranking countries.

fb_comments_count table:
created_at          : date
number_of_comments  : bigint
user_id             : bigint

fb_active_users table:
country   : text
name      : text
status    : text
user_id   : bigint

--- SOLUTION ---
select * from 
(select user_id from fb_comments_count) a
join 
(select user_id, country from fb_active_users) b
on a.user_id = b.user_id


--- WALKTHROUGH ---

Question: Most Active Users On Messenger
Source: stratascrach
Companies: Meta

Meta/Facebook Messenger stores the number of messages between users in a table named 'fb_messages'.
In this table 'user1' is the sender, 'user2' is the receiver, and 'msg_count' is the number of messages exchanged between them.
Find the top 10 most active users on Meta/Facebook Messenger by counting their total number of messages sent and received.
Your solution should output usernames and the count of the total messages they sent or received.

fb_messages table:
date       : date
id         : bigint
msg_count  : bigint
user1      : text
user2      : text

--- SOLUTION ---
WITH tb AS (SELECT 
    usern,
    SUM(msg_count) as total_msg,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(msg_count) DESC)
FROM 
    (SELECT 
        user1 AS usern, 
        msg_count
    FROM fb_messages
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        user2 AS usern, 
        msg_count
    FROM fb_messages) a
GROUP BY usern)

SELECT usern, total_msg FROM tb
WHERE dense_rank <=10
ORDER BY total_msg DESC
